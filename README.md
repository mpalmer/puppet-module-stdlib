# Puppet Standard Library

This module provides a "standard library" of resources for developing Puppet
modules.  This modules will include the following additions to Puppet

 * Facts
 * Functions
 * Defined resource types
 * Types
 * Providers

This module is a fork of the "officially curated" stdlib module provided by
Puppet Labs.  It incorporates a pile of changes which aren't considered
"kosher" by Puppet Labs, but which Anchor has found to be useful.


# Compatibility

The `2.x` branch of this module is compatible with the patched
Puppet 2.6 run by Anchor.
